# 🎨 Aether Art Space - Static Website Deployment Guide

## 📋 **For GoDaddy Hosting WITHOUT Node.js Support**

Since your hosting plan doesn't include Node.js support, here's how to deploy the **static website only**.

## ✅ **What You'll Get**

- ✅ **Full website** with all pages
- ✅ **Responsive design**
- ✅ **Exhibition galleries**
- ✅ **Artist profiles**
- ✅ **Artwork collections**
- ✅ **Contact page**
- ✅ **Newsletter subscription** (frontend only)

## ❌ **What You Won't Have**

- ❌ **Admin panel** (requires Node.js)
- ❌ **Database integration** (requires Node.js)
- ❌ **Content management** (requires Node.js)
- ❌ **File uploads** (requires Node.js)

## 🚀 **Static Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Prepare Files**

1. **Download** the `dist/` folder from the deployment package
2. **Contents should include**:
   - `index.html`
   - `assets/` folder
   - `collaborators/` folder
   - `logo/` folder
   - `favicon.ico`

### **Step 2: Upload to GoDaddy**

1. **Access cPanel** → **File Manager**
2. **Navigate to** `public_html/` folder
3. **Upload all files** from `dist/` folder
4. **Set permissions**:
   - Files: `644`
   - Folders: `755`

### **Step 3: Test Your Website**

1. **Visit** `yourdomain.com`
2. **Check all pages**:
   - Home page
   - Exhibitions
   - Artists
   - Gallery
   - About
   - Contact

## 🔧 **Configuration for Static Site**

Since there's no backend, you'll need to:

### **Update API Endpoints**

The website will try to connect to APIs that don't exist. You have two options:

**Option A: Mock Data (Recommended)**

- The website will show placeholder content
- All pages will be visible
- No dynamic content updates

**Option B: External API (Advanced)**

- Deploy backend to external service (Vercel, Heroku)
- Update API endpoints in the code
- More complex setup

## 📱 **What Works Out of the Box**

- ✅ **Navigation** between pages
- ✅ **Responsive design** on all devices
- ✅ **Image galleries** (with placeholder images)
- ✅ **Contact forms** (will show success message)
- ✅ **Newsletter signup** (will show success message)
- ✅ **All styling** and animations

## 🎯 **Quick Start**

1. **Upload** `dist/` folder contents to `public_html/`
2. **Visit** your domain
3. **Enjoy** your static website!

## 🔄 **Upgrading Later**

If you decide to upgrade to Node.js hosting later:

1. **Upgrade** your GoDaddy plan
2. **Deploy** the full-stack package
3. **Set up** database and admin panel
4. **Migrate** any content you've added

## 💡 **Benefits of Static Deployment**

- ✅ **Fast loading** (no server processing)
- ✅ **Reliable** (no server downtime)
- ✅ **Cost-effective** (basic hosting plan)
- ✅ **SEO-friendly** (static HTML)
- ✅ **CDN compatible** (can use Cloudflare)

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

**If pages don't load:**

- Check file permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)
- Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
- Clear browser cache

**If images don't show:**

- Check `assets/`, `collaborators/`, and `logo/` folders are uploaded
- Verify file paths are correct

**Note**: This is a static website deployment. For full functionality with admin panel and database, you'll need Node.js hosting support.
